## Overview 
The "UsedBooks" project is software system tailored for the efficient management and exchange of used textbooks, catering to both users and administrators. 
Its user-centric features enable seamless browsing and purchasing of books from any location, alongside an easy-to-use platform for selling unneeded books.

## For Users:

Browsing and Buying : Users can easily browse and purchase textbooks anytime, anywhere, providing convenience and flexibility.  
Selling Books : The platform enables users to sell textbooks they no longer need, simplifying the process of book recirculation.    

## For Administrators:

Enhanced Book Browsing : Administrators have improved tools for browsing book information, making data access more efficient.    
Data Management : The system allows for updating and sending alerts about book or user details, ensuring effective data control.    
Price Calculation : An automated feature for calculating used book prices aids in managing book inventory efficiently, streamlining the pricing process.    

## Tech-Stack

Spring Boot : Designed to streamline the configuration and deployment of Spring-based applications. It negates the need for extensive setup and configuration, offering an out-of-the-box solution
that reduces the time to market.  

Spring Data JPA : Part of the Spring Data project, simplifying the data access layer by reducing the amount of boilerplate code required. It provides a higher level of abstraction for database interactions,
making CRUD operations more straightforward.  

MySQL : A good option for an open-source relational database. It is highly popular for web applications due to its ease of use, robustness, and compatibility with a wide range of applications.  
Hibernate ORM : Pivotal in mapping Java classes to database tables, effectively synchronizing the object-oriented model with the relational database, thereby abstracting complex SQL operations into 
simpler Java-based handling.  

Spring MVC : instrumental in developing web applications with clear separation between the presentation layer and business logic. It allows developers to build scalable and flexible web applications
by organizing the codebase into manageable segments.  

Maven : A cornerstone tool for Java projects, addressing build automation and dependency management. It streamlines the build lifecycle, allowing for reproducible builds and easier project maintenance. 

Exception Handling : The project is customized to deal with specific business logic errors and exceptions, ensuring that the system behaves predictably and remains stable in the face of unexpected conditions.
